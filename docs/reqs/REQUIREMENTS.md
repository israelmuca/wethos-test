## Explicit Requirements

The requirements were very clear:

`1) Please write a little application that authenticates against the staging API server with your personal account, and then display a page with a summary of your user profile.`

We want a read-only app to login and present the user's profile in a summary.

`2) Somewhere in the app provide a link to the projects you have been added to; when you click the link, show a brief summary of the project however you like.`

Include the projects that are not shown in the current version of the app, through a link.

## Deadline

The project is to be delivered on Monday July 29th.

## Main focus

My main focus for this test, considering the time frame and requirements, is to cover:

- Mobile first design
- Performant
- Accessibility compliant
